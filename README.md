Deckster-Polymer
================

This is an exercise in learning the Polymer web component framework[http://www.polymer-project.org/] by implementing bits of Deckster [https://github.com/42sixsolutions/deckster].

You must install bower globally to use this.

    sudo npm install -g bower

This is a Node.js/Express project, so also do a simple `npm install` in the directory.

Then run `make`

Then run `node app`.
